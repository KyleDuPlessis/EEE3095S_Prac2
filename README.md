C++ optimisation techniques for embedded systems software development
----
Task:
----
This practical is designed to teach you core concepts which are fundamental to developing embedded systems in industry. It will show you the importance of C or C++ for embedded systems development. We’ll start by running a program in Python, and comparing it to the exact same program, but written in C++. This shows us the importance of using a particular language. From there, we we’ll try and improve the performance of the C code as much as possible, by using diﬀerent bit widths, compiler ﬂags, threading, and particular hardware available in the ARM Processor.
The quest for optimisation can lead one down a long, unending spiral. What is important to take away from this practical is awareness of concepts, the ability to use good practice when benchmarking.
